    /*
    Your library should correctly follow all SOLID principles:

    · Single Responsibility Principle - no class or method should do more than one thing at once.
    · Open-Closed Principle - the library should be open for extension. (i.e. its user should be able to create his own layouts/appenders/loggers)
    · Liskov Substitution Principle - children classes should not break the behavior of their parent.
    · Interface Segregation Principle - the library should provide simple interfaces for the client to implement.
    · Dependency Inversion - no class/method should directly depend on concretions (only on abstractions).
